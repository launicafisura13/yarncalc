## Welcome to YarnCalc

With this website you can calculate how much yarn you need for your next crochet or knitting project. 
All you need is the total length of yarn required for the pattern (in meters or yards). <br>
Optinally you can input the price of one skein of yarn and then the website will also calculate how much the yarn will cost you.
